# Pong

This is a basic pong game in VHDL for Xilinx Zedboard. The left player uses the buttons BTNL and BTND (up and down), 
the right player uses the buttons BTNU and BTNR (up and down) to move the paddles. 
You have to use a switch (SW0) to start the game. Don't forget to set it to 0 again otherwise it will be an endless game.
The reset button is BTNC.
